-- | This module provides a simple way of applying LTL formulas to lists, or
--   streams of input, to determine if a given formula matches some or all of
--   that input.
--
--   Formulas are written exactly as you would in LTL, but using names instead
--   of the typical symbols, for example:
--
-- @
-- always (is even @`until@` is odd)
-- @
--
--   Use 'run' to apply a formula to a list of inputs, returning either 'Left'
--   if it needs more input to determine the truth of the formula, or 'Right'
--   if it could determine truth from some prefix of that input.
--
--   Use 'step' to advance a formula by a single input. The return value has
--   the same meaning as 'run', but allows you to apply it in cases whether
--   you don't necessarily have all the inputs at once, such as feeding input
--   gradually within a conduit to check for logic failures.
--
--   For the meaning of almost all the functions in the module, see
--   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic
